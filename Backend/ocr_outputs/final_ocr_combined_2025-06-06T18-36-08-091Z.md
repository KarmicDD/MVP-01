### INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the members of BRIGHT HOSPITALITY PRIVATE LIMITED

#### Report on the Financial Statements

**Opinion**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of BRIGHT HOSPITALITY PRIVATE LIMITED ("the company"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2022, the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements give the information required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31st March 2022, its loss for the year ended on that date.

Our Report is not modified in respect of these matters.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards on auditing specified under section 143 (10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the code of ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the rules there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the code of ethics.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Reporting of key audit matters as per SA 701, Key Audit Matters are not applicable to the Company as it is an unlisted company.

**Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon**

The Company's board of directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Board's Report including Annexure to Board's Report, Business Responsibility Report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements**

The Company's board of directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134 (5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting standards specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so

The boards of directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

**Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

### Annexure 'A'

#### Report on Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

**Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")**

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of BRIGHT HOSPITALITY PRIVATE LIMITED ("the Company") as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

**Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls**

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

**Auditors' Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of Internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

**Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting**

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

1.  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2.  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3.  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

**Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting**

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India

**2. Significant accounting policies**

**a) Use of estimates**

The preparation of financial statement is conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management of the company to make adjustments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of financial statements and the result of operations during the reporting periods. Although these estimates are based upon management's knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from those estimates and revisions, if any, are recognized in current and future periods.

**b) Revenue Recognitions**

*   Interest Income is booked on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount invested and the rate of interest.
*   Profit on sale of investments is recognized on the date of its sale and is computed as excess of sale proceeds over its carrying amount as on date of sale.
*   Insurance and other claims are accounted for when settled/realized.
*   Revenue is recognized when goods are sold or services are rendered.

**c) Property, Plant & Equipment and depreciation**

Property, Plant and Equipment (gross block) are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments (if any). When items of the Property, Plant and Equipment are sold or scrapped, the corresponding cost and any accumulated depreciation are derecognized, and any gains or losses from disposal are recognized in the profit and loss account of the period.

The cost of the Property, Plant and Equipment consist of the purchase price, including freight, duties and other taxes and any directly attributable costs required to prepare the asset for its intended use. Any subsequent expenditure, such as services and maintenance charges arising once the assets is put into operation, is recognized as expense in the period in which it is incurred. Subsequent expenditures relating to an item of Property, Plant and Equipment are only added to the carrying amount of the Property, Plant and Equipment if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the company and its cost of that item can be measured reliably.

If significant parts of an item property, plant and equipment have different useful life then they are accounted and depreciated for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

The company followed the Written down Value method in the manner and useful life of the assets as specified in the Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013 and consequent depreciation rates as derived therefrom. Residual value of the all the tangible Property, Plant and Equipment have been considered as 5% of cost of acquisition in compliance with the said schedule.

Individual low cost Property, Plant and Equipment (acquired for less than Rs 5,000/-) are depreciated in full in the year of purchase.

Intangible Assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a Written down Value method basis; commencing from the date the asset is available to the company for its use.

The useful lives and residual values of the assets being in the nature of management estimates are reviewed at each reporting date.

**d) Provisions and Contingent Liabilities**

A provision is recognized when an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not discounted to its present value and are determined based on best estimated required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at the balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

Reimbursement expected in respect of expenditure required to settle a provision is recognized only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received.

Depending on facts of each case and after due evaluation of the relevant legal aspects, claims against the company not acknowledged as debts are provided or disclosed as contingent liabilities. In respect of statutory matters, contingent liabilities are provided or disclosed only for those demand(s) that are contested by the Company.

**e) Impairment of Assets**

The Company will assess at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and the reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the profit and loss account. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of depreciated historical cost and is accordingly reversed in the profit and loss account.

**f) Foreign Currency Transaction**

The Company neither has earnings in foreign currency nor has it incurred any expenditure in foreign currency.

**g) Taxation**

Tax expense comprises of current income tax, deferred tax.

Current income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 as applicable to the financial year.

Deferred income taxes reflects the impact of current year timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the year and reversal of timing differences of earlier years. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized.

Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) credit is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period. MAT credit becomes eligible to be recognized as an asset in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Guidance Note issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the said asset is created by way of credit to the profit and loss account and shown as MAT credit entitlement. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period.

**h) Investments**

Non-current investments are stated at cost. A provision for diminution is made to recognize a decline, other than temporary, in the value of long-term investments.

Current investments are stated at lower of cost and fair value for each investment individually.

**i) Earning Per Share**

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends if any and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for events of bonus issue to existing shareholders and share split.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares from the exercise of options on unissued share capital. The number of equity shares is the aggregate of the weighted average number of equity shares and the weighted average number of equity shares, which would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares. Options on unissued equity share capital (if any) are deemed to have been converted into equity shares.
