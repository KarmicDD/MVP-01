Personalized Scalability Plan for KarmicDD
Based on your codebase analysis, here's a comprehensive plan for scaling your application with best practices tailored specifically to your architecture and requirements.

1. Service Decomposition Strategy
Current Architecture Pain Points
Your monolithic Express server handles everything from authentication to AI processing
MongoDB and PostgreSQL connections are initialized at server startup
Document processing and AI operations block the main thread
Rate limiting is implemented per-user but not at the service level
Decomposition Guidelines
Authentication & User Management

Extract from src/controllers/authController.ts and src/middleware/auth.ts
Keep JWT validation logic consistent across services
Maintain user role enforcement (startup vs investor)
Profile Management

Extract from src/controllers/profileController.ts
Separate startup and investor profile logic
Keep document metadata separate from content
Document Management

Extract from src/controllers/profileController.ts (document upload/download)
Separate metadata operations from content processing
Move from filesystem to S3-compatible storage
AI Processing (Monolithic Core)

Consolidate all Gemini API interactions and core AI logic (e.g., from `src/services/EnhancedDocumentProcessingService.ts`, `src/services/AIInsightsService.ts`) into a dedicated AI Processing module that remains part of the monolith.
This module will handle all direct communication with Gemini APIs.
Maintain caching mechanisms for AI results within this monolithic module.
Search & Matching

Extract from src/controllers/searchController.ts and src/services/MLMatchingService.ts
Separate basic search from AI-powered matching
2. Data Management Strategy
Current Data Challenges
Dual database architecture adds complexity
Document storage on filesystem limits scalability
MongoDB models have complex relationships
Cache invalidation is manual and error-prone
Data Layer Improvements
Database Access Patterns

Create dedicated data access layers for each service
Example: Convert src/models/Profile/StartupProfile.ts to a service with clear interfaces
Implement repository pattern to abstract database operations
Connection Management

Data Partitioning Strategy

Partition MongoDB collections by user type (startup/investor)
For PostgreSQL, implement proper indexing on user_id and role columns
Consider time-based partitioning for analytics data
Document Storage Migration

Move from local filesystem to S3
Update document paths in MongoDB
Implement signed URLs for secure access
Maintain consistent metadata structure
3. API Design Guidelines
Current API Challenges
Routes are tightly coupled to controllers
Error handling is inconsistent
Authentication is mixed with business logic
API versioning is not implemented
API Improvements
API Gateway Configuration

Create separate route groups for each service domain
Map current routes from src/routes/index.ts to appropriate services:
/api/auth/* → Authentication service
/api/profile/* → Profile service
/api/financial/* → AI Processing service
etc.
Standardized Response Format

Error Handling

Create domain-specific error types
Standardize HTTP status code usage
Implement consistent error logging
Maintain your existing errorHandler middleware pattern
API Versioning

Implement API versioning in URL path (/v1/auth/login)
Support backward compatibility for existing clients
4. Authentication & Security Strategy
Current Security Challenges
JWT secrets are in environment variables
CORS is configured but could be more restrictive
File uploads have basic validation
Rate limiting is basic
Security Improvements
JWT Management

Move from local JWT validation to a dedicated auth service
Implement short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens
Consider AWS Cognito for managed authentication
API Security

Implement proper rate limiting at API Gateway level
Add request validation using JSON Schema
Implement WAF rules for common attack patterns
Add CSRF protection for browser clients
File Security

Enhance validation for uploaded files (content type verification)
Scan uploads for malware
Implement strict access controls on S3 buckets
Generate short-lived signed URLs for document access
Database Security

Use IAM roles for database access
Implement column-level encryption for sensitive data
Use VPC endpoints for private network access
Regularly rotate credentials
5. Caching Strategy
Current Caching Challenges
AI results are cached in MongoDB with TTL
No application-level caching for frequent queries
No distributed caching mechanism
Caching Improvements
Multi-Level Caching

Implement Redis for distributed caching
Cache AI results with appropriate TTL
Cache frequently accessed profiles and documents
Implement cache invalidation on updates
Cache Keys Design

Cache Invalidation Strategy

Implement event-based cache invalidation
Use SNS to publish data change events
Subscribe cache invalidation handlers to relevant topics
Caching Policies

For AI results: 7-day TTL (as in your current code)
For user profiles: 1-hour TTL with invalidation on update
For document metadata: 24-hour TTL with invalidation on update
For search results: 15-minute TTL
6. Asynchronous Processing
Current Async Challenges
Document processing is synchronous
AI operations block API responses
No job queue for background tasks
Async Processing Improvements
Message Queue Implementation

Implement SQS for task queuing
Create separate queues for different processing types:
document-processing-queue
financial-analysis-queue
compatibility-scoring-queue
Background Processing

Move document processing to background jobs
Implement webhook callbacks for long-running operations
Use WebSockets for real-time status updates
Job Status Tracking

Create a job tracking service
Store job status in DynamoDB
Implement polling endpoint for status checks
Retry Mechanisms

Implement exponential backoff for failed jobs
Set appropriate visibility timeouts for SQS messages
Create dead-letter queues for failed processing
7. Monitoring & Observability
Current Monitoring Challenges
Basic console logging
No structured logging
No performance metrics
No distributed tracing
Monitoring Improvements
Logging Strategy

Implement structured JSON logging
Add correlation IDs across services
Log appropriate context without sensitive data
Set log levels based on environment
Metrics Collection

Track key performance indicators:
API response times
Database query performance
AI processing duration
Error rates by endpoint
Alerting Configuration

Set up alerts for:
Error rate thresholds
API latency spikes
Database connection issues
Queue depth exceeding thresholds
Distributed Tracing

Implement AWS X-Ray or similar
Trace requests across services
Identify performance bottlenecks
Visualize service dependencies
8. Infrastructure as Code
Current Infrastructure Challenges
Manual deployment
Environment configuration in .env files
No infrastructure versioning
Limited deployment automation
IaC Improvements
Terraform Configuration

Define all AWS resources in Terraform
Organize by service domain
Implement state management in S3
Use workspaces for different environments
Environment Management

Create separate environments:
Development
Staging
Production
Implement environment-specific configurations
Use AWS Parameter Store for secrets
CI/CD Pipeline

Automate testing and deployment
Implement infrastructure validation
Configure deployment approvals for production
Resource Naming Convention

Conclusion: KarmicDD-Specific Considerations
Based on your specific codebase, the most critical aspects to focus on are:

AI Processing Optimization: Your Gemini API integration is central to your application's value. Ensure it's properly isolated, cached, and scalable.
Document Processing Pipeline: Your current document processing is filesystem-based and synchronous. Prioritize migrating this to S3 and implementing asynchronous processing.
Dual Database Strategy: Your hybrid PostgreSQL/MongoDB approach adds complexity. Ensure clear boundaries between data stored in each system and optimize access patterns.
Authentication Flow: Your JWT implementation needs to be consistent across services. Extract this first to ensure all other services can validate tokens properly.
Rate Limiting: Your AI operations have strict rate limits. Implement proper queuing and throttling to prevent API limit errors.
By following this personalized plan, you'll be able to scale your application efficiently while maintaining the core functionality that makes KarmicDD valuable to your users. The hybrid Lambda/monolith approach will give you the best balance of cost-efficiency and performance for your specific workload patterns.
